# Dizce [Full App]

Dizce is a project thought as a website of a company, which has the objective of helping people access information in other languages without them needing to learn them, and main functionality being a page where users can find educative websites from and in three different languages (German, English, Spanish) with their respective descriptions and links.

This is the full App, ready for deploy. Take into consideration that this part of the project is focused on the backend and you won't be able to edit the frontend as it uses the production 'build'.

## Main Technology

Node JS

## Code style

**Language**: English

The code is not 100% polished and there are many things that could have been done better, however the goal is very well achieved.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Dizce [frontend].

```bash
npm install
```

And make sure to set up the respective environment variables (model in env.sample) because otherwise many problems could arise.
